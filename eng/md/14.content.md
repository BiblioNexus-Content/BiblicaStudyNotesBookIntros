## 2 Chronicles (id: 499075)

**What is the book of 2 Chronicles?**

* 2 Chronicles is an account of Israel’s history. These events took place between the years 970 and 538 BC. The stories about these events were passed down for hundreds of years. They were passed down within Israelite and Jewish families.
* It’s thought that Ezra might have written some of these stories down. It’s thought that they were written down around the year 430 BC. This was after some Jews returned to Judah from being forced to live in Babylon.
* Other parts were written down by other Jews.
* 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles were one book when they were first written down. Later they were divided into two books. They include many events and stories recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings.

**Who was this book written for?**
