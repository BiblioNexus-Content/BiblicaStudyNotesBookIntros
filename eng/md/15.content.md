## Ezra (id: 499076)

**What is the book of Ezra?**

* The book of Ezra is an account of Jewish history when the Persian government ruled. These events took place between the years 538 and 457 BC. The stories about these events were passed down within Jewish families for hundreds of years.
* It’s thought that Ezra wrote some of this account down.
* Other parts were written down by other Jews.
* The books of Ezra and Nehemiah were one book when they were first written down. Later they were divided into two books.

**Who was this book written for?**

* For Jews who had returned to Judah. They had lived in exile in Babylon for many years.

**Why was Ezra written?**
