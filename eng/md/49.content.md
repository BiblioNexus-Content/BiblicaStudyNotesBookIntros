## Ephesians (id: 499044)

**What is the book of Ephesians?**

* The book of Ephesians is a letter from Paul.
* Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter. It’s thought that he wrote it around the year AD 60\.

**Who was Ephesians written to?**

* To believers in southwestern Asia Minor. Some were Jews but most were Gentiles.
* The oldest copies of this letter don’t say that it was to believers in Ephesus. This means that it was a general letter to churches in several cities. The letter was read out loud in churches all around Asia Minor. This included the church at Ephesus.
* Paul hadn’t met all the believers he was writing to.
* Followers of Jesus recognise that Ephesians shares the truth about Jesus. It’s for all people everywhere.

**Why was Ephesians written?**

* To talk about God’s plan for the whole world.
* To describe who Jesus Christ is and what the church is.

**Main ideas**

* Having peace through Christ.
* Being saved through having faith in Jesus Christ and by God’s grace.
* Christ’s work mattering for everything that God made.
* The church as a body, as a temple and as somewhere people belong as citizens. The church as God’s family and as Christ’s bride.
