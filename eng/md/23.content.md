## Isaiah (id: 499084)

**What is the book of** **Isaiah?**

* Isaiah is a book of Israel’s prophets. It’s a collection of messages from God and includes some stories from Isaiah’s life. These stories are also recorded in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles.
* Most of the messages were about the people and leaders of the southern kingdom.
* These messages were spoken over a period of many years. Isaiah prophesied while Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah were kings of the southern kingdom. He prophesied from around the year 740 BC to around the year 680 BC.
* The messages talk about events during the rules of those kings. They also talk about events that happened much later. This includes events after Babylon took control of the southern kingdom. It includes events after Persia took control of Babylon. It also includes events that haven’t happened yet.
* Most of the messages were written down as poems or as songs.
