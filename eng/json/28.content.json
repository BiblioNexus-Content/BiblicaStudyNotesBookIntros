    "content": "<p><strong>What is the book of</strong> <strong>Hosea?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Hosea is a book of Israel’s prophets. It’s a collection of messages from God and stories about Hosea’s life.</p></li><li><p>Most of the messages were about the people and leaders of the northern kingdom.</p></li><li><p>These messages were spoken over a period of many years. Hosea prophesied when the last seven kings of the northern kingdom ruled. He prophesied from around the year 750 BC to around the year 722 BC.</p></li><li><p>The messages talk about events from those years. This includes when Assyria took control of the northern kingdom in 722 BC. They also talk about events that haven’t happened yet.</p></li><li><p>The messages were written down as poems.</p></li><li><p>It’s thought that Hosea wrote down parts of this book. Other parts were written down by other Israelites.</p></li><li><p>New Testament writers understood that some of Hosea’s prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus’ life and work.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Who was this book written for?</strong></p><ul><li><p>For the people of the northern kingdom of Israel.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why was Hosea written?</strong></p><ul><li><p>To accuse the people and leaders of the northern kingdom. They had not been faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant.</p></li><li><p>To urge them to be faithful to God. If they were faithful to him, God wouldn’t bring judgement against them.</p></li><li><p>To give them hope for their future after the time of judgement. The hope was based on God’s faithful love for them.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main ideas</strong></p><ul><li><p>Hosea’s marriage was a picture of the relationship between God and the northern kingdom.</p></li><li><p>The covenant curses would come to the people and leaders of the northern kingdom.
